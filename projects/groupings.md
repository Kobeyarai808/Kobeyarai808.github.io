summary: UHGroupings is a project that I joined in 2020. The website allows you to create, organize, and manage a group of people associated with the University of Hawaii. Members can be grouped by their emails, roles, lists that they belong to, and much more. A owner of a grouping can allow users to either be included or excluded from a grouping based on their relevance to the group and members can opt out of groups if they are no longer want to be affiliated with the group.
