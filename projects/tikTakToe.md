While stuck at home durring the COVID-19 Pandemic, I wanted to be useful and create a Tik Tak Toe Game. I built a regular Tik Tak Toe game along with a command line based GUI. Source code is on Github and can be viewed and built on your machine. There are 3 modes, A single-player against randomized moves computer, A single-player against a AI which will never loose, and finally a Multi-player which allows multiple players to play.
