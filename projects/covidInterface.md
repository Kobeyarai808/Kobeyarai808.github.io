I created a COVID-19 Data Data Parser that parsed information off of a CSV file that had information collected from the United States. 

Information found on the CSV include:
date, state, death, deathConfirmed, deathIncrease, deathProbable, hospitalized, hospitalizedCumulative, hospitalizedCurrently, hospitalizedIncrease, inIcuCumulative, inIcuCurrently, negative, negativeIncrease, negativeTestsAntibody, negativeTestsPeopleAntibody, negativeTestsViral, onVentilatorCumulative, onVentilatorCurrently, positive, positiveCasesViral, positiveIncrease, positiveScore, positiveTestsAntibody, positiveTestsAntigen, positiveTestsPeopleAntibody, positiveTestsPeopleAntigen, positiveTestsViral, recovered, totalTestEncountersViral, totalTestEncountersViralIncrease, totalTestResults, totalTestResultsIncrease, totalTestsAntibody, totalTestsAntigen, totalTestsPeopleAntibody, totalTestsPeopleAntigen, totalTestsPeopleViral, totalTestsPeopleViralIncrease, totalTestsViral, totalTestsViralIncrease
