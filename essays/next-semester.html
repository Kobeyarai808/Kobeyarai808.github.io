  <h2 id="ics-414">ICS 414</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the semester in ICS 414, we were put into 4 groups. Our task, to create an application for the Hawaii State Department of Education. This app would replace an aging system that the DOE used to track bills going through the legislature. This is important because majority of the funds needed to run the department come from the legislature. We had about 9 members per group, my team a-doe-bo was a group who consisted of a few members I got to know in the 314 project so it was great to work with them again.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>I really thought my experience in this class and with my group was good. It was nice that we had hard-working members and that we were able to come through, finishing the project in-time for the final presentation. There were some hiccups along the way which included things such as group members not being productive at times, but we were able to overcome these obstacles and move on. It was important that we all listen to one another and take each others opinion into account when moving the team forward. One of the many difficulties were that with such a large team and a small code base, conflicts came up often and sometimes Git did not even catch the conflicts and would allow conflicting code to be checked into main.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As someone with experience in web app development in the professional setting, I believe that ICS 314 and 414 are a great starting point into real-world agile scrum development. With a few tweaks, the curriculum could really mimic a team of developers. The only challenge was that we are students and not full time who are working 40 hours a week so a full mock work environment would not work out. It is also important to note that we do not have project managers that can act as a scrum master.  Since our team performed well and really just worked hand in hand to push a common goal forward, I am hopeful that I will one day meet and collaborate with some of these team members again.</p>
